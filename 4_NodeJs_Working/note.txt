client makes request to server

1.Event Queue:Sare requests event queue ke undar queue hoti hai 
2.Event Loop:Uske bad event loop me request jati hai 
            Event loop keeps a check ki koi request aayi ya ny
            queue se request uthata hai FIFO form me

            request 2 tareeke ke ho sakte hai Blocking Operation(Synchornous) and Non-Blocking-Operation(Asynchronous)

            1.Agar non blocking hai to process kardega and send response to user
            2.Blocking request hai to thread pole ke pass jaega

3.Thread Pool: isme threads hote hai aur ye blocking operation karta hai 
            Agar worker available hai to usko request assign kardega aur result bhej dega user ko
            By default size: 4 (Maxm depends on machine based on cpu threads)
Problem: Thread limited hote hai 
        agar sare worker busy to wait karna padega jab free hoga worker tabhi next execution

So it is always good to have non blocking operations


---------------------------------------------

jaise 5 lines ke code hai to blocking me ek ke bad ek execute hoga
but non blocking me pahle bhi ho sakta hai agar beech wale me time lag rha hai to
